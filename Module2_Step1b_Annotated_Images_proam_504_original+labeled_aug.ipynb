We will be using the python package **abumentations** for video frame augmentation. Data Augmentation is expected to benefit the Deep Learning based YOLOV4-tiny Object Detection Model.\n","\n","Wherever there is a comment for **## UPDATE** the code (often a path) needs to be updated\n","\n","Libraries involved:\n","1. opencv-python-headless==4.5.5.62 \n","2. albumentations\n","3. os\n","4. shutil\n","5. random\n","6. zipfile\n","7. watermark\n","\n","Steps involved:\n","1.

STEP3: Loading the Image Folder, cleaning the class and bounding box text file if needed (often the original bounding box would have multiple detected class IDs which need to be revised as we are only detecting a single class -the tennis ball)\n","4. STEP4. Zipping the original image folder, as this zipped file will be used in the YOLOv4-tiny Object Detection process\n","5. STEP5.
